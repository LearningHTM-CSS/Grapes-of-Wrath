      <h1>Chapter 10 Summary</h1>
      <p>Pa and John go into town to sell the family's belongings.
Tom and Ma Joad have a heart-to-heart about California. Ma is worried that the golden state is not what it's cracked up to be.
Pa and John return from their adventure feeling embarrassed. They were only able to get $18 for all of their earthly possessions.
We meet twelve year-old Ruthie, ten year-old Winfield, and a pregnant Rose of Sharon.
Ruthie and Winfield are mischievous; Rose of Sharon is moony-eyed over her nineteen year-old husband, Connie Rivers.
The family hangs out by the truck and chitchats.
Ma cooks up a delicious dinner, while the men decide that the family will leave the next morning. They are itching to leave.
The Joads agree to let Reverend Casy join them on their trip westward. It's always good to have a preacher on board.
There's some pig-slaughtering and pig-salting action.
The next morning, everything gets packed onto the Joad truck, but Grampa doesn't want to leave. He gets very stubborn about this.
Ma puts sleepytime cough medicine in Grampa's coffee, and so he falls asleep instantly. The Joads carry him into the car.
The Joads say bye-bye to their house.</p>
