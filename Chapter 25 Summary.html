      <h1>Chapter 25 Summary</h1>
      <p>Spring in California is prettier than just about anything you can imagine. It's a paradise. The state grows full and rich with fruit.
There are blossoms everywhere.
Farmers are like surgeons, like artists. They know how to cultivate the land, to watch for disease, to graft trees, to nurture their produce.
But the economy is so poor, that 40 five-pound barrels of pears sell for a mere $5.
The farmers with small farms can't make a profit, can't afford to give their food away.
Meanwhile, thousands of people are starving all across California.
Landowners spray kerosene on the oranges so that people won't steal them.
All over California, beautiful food is rotting.
All over California, people are dying from hunger.
There is a "growing wrath" among the people; in their souls "the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy" (25.19).
