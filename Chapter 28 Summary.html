      <h1>Chapter 28 Summary</h1>
      <p>The Joads settle in one end of a boxcar, and it is super comfy.
Money starts rolling in from the cotton picking, and the Joads get to buy things like overalls and pork chops. They are living large.
A bully steals Ruthie's Cracker Jack from her, and Ruthie gets into a fight with said bully. She tells her that her brother Tom can kill her brother, because he's already killed two men. In other words, Ruthie spills the Tom beans.
When Ma realizes that the Tom beans have been spilt, she goes in search of Tom, bringing him some pork chops and potatoes.
Ma and Tom hang out in his palace of bushes. Tom tells her he's been doing a lot of thinking about Reverend Casy. Tom wants to help organize the migrant workers. He wants to try to bring justice to the starving hordes of people in California.
Ma and Tom say goodbye.
On her way back to camp, Ma encounters a man who tells her that a small cotton farm down the road will need pickers the next morning. Ma tells him she and her family will be there bright and early.
Ma returns to the boxcar, and guess what? Al and Aggie Wainwright (the daughter of the family who lives in the other end of the boxcar) are engaged! Time for pancakes.
The next morning, the Joads and the Wainwrights drive to the cotton farm down the road.
Rose of Sharon insists on picking cotton, too, even though she's kind of sick and weak and very pregnant.
Tons of workers show up to pick cotton, and there's not really enough work to go around.
On the drive home, it starts to rain, and Rose of Sharon starts to get a chill.
Everyone huddles together in the boxcar, building up the fire, and trying to keep dry.
