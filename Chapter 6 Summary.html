      <h1>Chapter 6 Summary</h1>
      <p>Tom and Casy inspect the Joad home, but something is amiss. It's completely empty, but nothing has been stolen.
The two deduce that there aren't any neighbors around. If there were neighbors, the house would have been pulled apart, and the lumber would have been stolen.
Muley Graves stops by. Muley is an old friend of the Joads, and he's gone a bit batty. But he knows what's going on.
Tom's parents are staying at his Uncle John's house, and his family is getting ready to move to California.
Muley tells Tom about how his family lost their land. Willey Feeley, another family friend, drove the tractor that dug up their yard and that crushed their house.
Muley's own family has gone west, but he won't budge. He's made it his job to be a perpetual thorn in the landowners' sides. He doesn't want to leave his land.

Since Uncle John Joad's house is eight miles away, the men decide to camp at the abandoned Joad home for the night.
Muley shares the jackrabbits he caught and killed with Tom and Casy, and Tom has a really good time skinning and cooking the rabbit meat.
On the horizon, the men see a car's lights.
They hide in the cornrows while the men investigate the campsite. Technically, the men are trespassing on private property. Muley knows all of the landowners' habits and routines.
The men decide to spend the night in a riverbed, well-hidden from the world.</p>
