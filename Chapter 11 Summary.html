      <h1>Chapter 11 Summary</h1>
      <p>The houses that the tenant farmers leave behind slowly deteriorate.
Local kids come and break the windows with rocks.
Mice move in and get cozy, and the cats hunt the mice.
The wind slowly begins to pull the roof off the buildings.
Everything is empty, empty, empty.</p>
