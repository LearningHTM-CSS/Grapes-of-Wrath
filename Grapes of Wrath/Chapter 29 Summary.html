      <h1>Chapter 29 Summary</h1>
      <p>The winter rains hit California hard, soaking and flooding the fields and orchards.
Rain means no work for the migrant workers; no work means no food for the thousands of starving families.
People can't get dry, diseases thrive, and the cars die from having been soaked with water.
Many grow desperate for food, resorting to robbery in order to survive.
Landowners and merchants gather guns and tighten their security to protect themselves from the wrath of the workers and their families.
Eventually the rain stops, but the families know there will be no work until springtime.
