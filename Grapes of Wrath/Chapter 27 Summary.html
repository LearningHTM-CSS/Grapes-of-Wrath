      <h1>Chapter 27 Summary</h1>
      <p>Little yellow handbills are strewn all over California, boasting of plenty of work for cotton pickers.
A picker who fills a giant bag full of cotton can earn eight cents for it.
The bags are weighed by a clerk. Corruption abounds. Some pickers put rocks in their bags in order to make it weigh more. Some clerks don't keep accurate records of the amount a worker has picked.
Cotton gets everywhere, especially up your nose.
