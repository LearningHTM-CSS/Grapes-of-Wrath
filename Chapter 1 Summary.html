    <h1>Chapter 1 Summary</h1>
    <p>There's big-time drought in Oklahoma, folks. Everything dries up under the fierce sun.
In mid-June, dark rain clouds form up above, but they pass by without dropping rain.
In the wake of the rain clouds come fierce winds, and the winds kick up the dry earth and the dust that has been baking under the sun.
Dust storms form, and they are so thick that you can't even see the sun. They drive the Oklahomans inside their homes.
The crops are ruined.</p>
