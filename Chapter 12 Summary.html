      <h1>Chapter 12 Summary</h1>
      <p>Highway 66 is a famous road. It carried thousands of people west toward California during the Dust Bowl.
The families who crowd into their used cars learn how to listen to their cars. They listen for any kind of breaking-down sounds.
On the road they meet mechanics and car salesman who again try to rip them off. These merchants tell them that they're silly to believe that there is opportunity in California.
The families keep on keeping on.</p>
