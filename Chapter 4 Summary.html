    <h1>Chapter 4 Summary</h1>
    <p>This chapter is about a turtle, but not just any turtleâ€”a really tough turtle.
Lots of things get in this turtle's way. For example a fire ant crawls into his shell (ouch).
Why did the turtle cross the road? To avoid the crazy drivers. One woman swerves out of the way in order not to hit our favorite turtle. Another driver intentionally tries to hit our turtle.
Don't worry, the turtle is okay. That shell does come in handy.</p>
