      <h1>Chapter 14 Summary</h1>
      <p>Our narrator speaks to the landowners and the banks and all of the people responsible for kicking thousands of tenant farmers off the land during the dust bowl.
Our narrator warns these powerful entities that, while it may be easy to manipulate a single family, it won't be as easy to push around a group of families that have banded together.
Basically, there is strength in numbers. Watch out, landowners.</p>
